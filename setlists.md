...adds up to 35 mins - need to trim

## Issues

- a: More programming needed
- b: Finalise lyrics
- c: Finalise structure
- d: fzbx coding needed
- e: guitar part 

## TODO

- Practice with fzbx - sliders for fuzz and comp only - leave stab and gate to manual - allows fine tuning

### Rehearsal, 180129

I tried to do the whole set, but there were problems with the fuzzbox and touchosc, and I don't have a playlist yet, so I did what I could. Unfortunately the vocals are a little quiet on the recording. Whilst I was performing, I felt as if there was something missing, but listening back, it's not bad! In the list below, songs in brackets werent' done!

- *(Into The Silence)* - need to get the midi file sorted for this.
- *Actually Reading Comics* - haven't quite got the structure there yet. Maybe some sonic cues to know when to sing?
- *Red Mecca Bingo* - First time I've sung through. Need to learn the words, but it's going well. No Fzbx in this atm! Glitchy drums seemed to work...
- *(Climate Denial)* - didn't have the guitar set up 
- *Martyn Lives* - there's a good bit where I 'beat' the fzbx in time with the drums...
- *End of the Terrace* - It's quite good fun doing this without the sequencer - but it would be good to set the volca up with a quick MIDI parameter sweep before hand. Not hard to do. Of course it works better when touchosc is playing ball!
- *Click Bait* - **really** fuxed up drums - but it seemed to work. Touchosc couldn't play the roadrunner - need to set that up better also - possibly have a range of different memory options
- *Creative Supply* - The drums need fixing! - word timing needs working on
- *Walk Around* - Drums need fixing again - liked the mucking about with the volca though. Possibly introduce a dropout on the bar starting `debt fuelled worry`
- *We Are So Facile* - ran out of time - would have needed to code it up...
- *To Get Music*


Need to make sure the following are fixed:

- fzbx - it isn't behaving - I've unplugged one of the three leads from the gain switch to the breadboard - hoping that's it! Possibly remove the #define for MIDI out also - it doesn't update touchosc anyway...
- touchosc - wouldn't connect to fzbx, but it was linking up with the BME and volca... need to check what version is the latest on the fzbx...
- vocals - set the mixer up better
- playlist - let's get on this first - it makes things so much easier
- UBUNTU - which one am I going to use? 16.04 with unity looks good atm.
