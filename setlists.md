This was at short notice - no time to alter the set from the previous gig at the Woolpack - even if I wanted to!
Had to rebuild the OscFac and the PotNoodle as they'd been dismantled...


## Set

- *Actually Reading Comics*
- *Red Mecca Bingo*
- *Martyn Lives*
- *Click Bait*
- *To Get Music*
- *We Are So Facile*
- *Creative Supply*

## Post Mortem

OscFac seemed to fail sometime during ToGetMusic - didn't recover it, but
didn't try that hard - worried about overdoing it... Somehow I hit the 
mute button on the laptop

## Post Mortem

Had initial trouble setting up because I'd plugged the midi cable

...adds up to 35 mins - need to trim

## Issues

- a: More programming needed
- b: Finalise lyrics
- c: Finalise structure

- e: guitar part 

## TODO

### Crumar

- set up memory properly


### fzbx

- Practice with fzbx - sliders for fuzz and comp only - leave stab and gate to manual - allows fine tuning
- fuzzbox switching for guitar.
- Try fzbx with dist and comp only on arduino - see if that'll work...
- memorize good guitar setting for
