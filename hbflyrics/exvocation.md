This is my 
ex vocation
no need to explain
the public malaise
post-industrial posts on social media

20 summers left


I sneer and I snipe

a ten mile long vapour trail 
of unfinished projects   
lies in my wake  
no need to explain  
no need to explain  
no need to do them
or revisit at all  

20 summers left

what money I have makes no interest
what interests I have make no money

the depression  
came back
