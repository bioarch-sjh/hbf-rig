# Look Down

## Background

I was reading a list of Stephen Hawking quotes here: [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/14/best-stephen-hawking-quotes-quotations]

One that struck me was this: 

*Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. 
Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. 
Be curious. 
And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. 
It matters that you donâ€™t just give up.*

The song is called *Look Down* because it celebrates the opposite viewpoint - that there is comfort in giving up.

## Lyrics


Look Down at your feet, don't consider the stars\
You can't make sense of what you see


However easy life may seem, there is always something you can fail at. 
It's easier if you give up.

Pass me the remote
