###Martyn Lives

Got the drums - need to find the BME700 Memory to go with it - think it might be in the tightrope foder (it's memory 3 in the tightrope BME folder)

###Creative Supply 

Was called Peasholme Green 74 in HBF dropbox/scripts/nextset/set

Again - have to find the bass sound: Have found one similar with a different fall value for now. 

###To Get Music

Drums need a lot of work to get right - fit in with the other sounds

Bassline is currrenlty on the Volca - do I want to stay with that, and if so, I'll have to figure out the settings - not sure at the moment what they are - surface not recorded - did I take a photo? Yes - see photos.google.com, 3 Dec 2016! Good system! - have recorded this in seq24 now.

Moved the miniAtm stuff to the BME - screeshot 170519 shows the settings (it's fucked up memory 2 with added glide...) - The vibra level could do with toning down a bit for the lower note - perhaps do this in the MIDI surface??
