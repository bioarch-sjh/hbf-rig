#	Behaviour is as follows
#	If there is no numbered file for the corresponding number on the BME700 mem console, then the default setting will be loaded
#	If a memory file with the right name is copied to the folder, BME700 will load it next time its number is selected
#	This means it's possible to load as many memories as you like without having to restart BME700
#	BUT: The mod console behavoir is unknown - need to research further how to control this.
