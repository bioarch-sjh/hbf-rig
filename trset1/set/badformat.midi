So what is the best time to eat to stay healthy?
Studies on mice have clearly shown that allowing them to eat only when they are naturally awake, which is at night because they are nocturnal, results in fewer metabolic defects. They are healthier and less obese than mice allowed to eat all day and night long. Similarly, a study by Frank Scheer at Harvard Medical School on 420 dieters in Spain found that those who ate their main meal before 3pm lost more weight than those who ate later. The message appears simple: make lunch your biggest meal of the day.
