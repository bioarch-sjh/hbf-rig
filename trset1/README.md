#bme700

Currently the following sounds are stored:

1 - A good sound - don't think it's used at present - good alternative to 5
2 - Harsh noise - unused, but reliable across the keyboard
3 - MartynLives bass (an hbf sound)
4 - Unlike Me
5 - Default Tightrope bass
6 - A bit of a 'quack' - loud attack, fast decay, quiet sustain, immediate release
7 - A 'stock' memory - poppy bass - used on one of the experimental tracks from around 2014
8 - Heavy bass

##hbf bme 

There was a bug with the roadrunner.sh - it wrote the roadrunner memories to the bme700 directory - resulting in some really strange sounds! 

###Currently
1 - grainy alternative to 5
2 - Harsh noise
3 - MartynLives
4 - Unlike Me
5 - Default Tightrope
6 - No Note Off
7 - stock pop
8 - Heavy Bass


###Used to be (stored in 170529 subdir);
*Worth keeping note of this as we keep getting confused...*

1 - Another good sound - different to 1 in trset1/BME700 - don't delete!
2 - Another harsh noise
3 - whooshing
4 - slow fade in whooshin
5 - A strange clicky LFO thing
6 - A bit of a 'quack' - loud attack, fast decay, quiet sustain, immediate release
7 - A 'stock' memory - poppy bass - used on one of the experimental tracks from around 2014
8 - Harpsichord type thing
