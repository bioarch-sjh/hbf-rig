#Gig post mortem

*Not the best... Drum machine fucked up the first half of the set until I reset it. Sounded ok after that, but the damage was done. Some liked it  -or were polite about it at least*

- **Meaningful Work** just didn't work with the drums. Had to abandon it.
- **Gob Can** made it through this one with strange thumpy sounds
- **Fizz Bang** sounded mighty fine in soundcheck, but was a bit wonky with the bass drum missing
- **Sometimes a great notion** stumbled through this one. It fell to bits tbh. Underrehearsed probly
- **Landfill Music** had to restart the drum machine cos it just wasn't woiking. Went with the stock sounds - ripped out the potnoodle switch box also - it seemed to settle down then. Could play stuff after that
- **ii am yr jb** Did a good version of this I think - possibly the highlight of the set
- **Ckimate Deniak** Went well, ended well. Middle bit didn't seem that great this time - trying to do too much.. Need some more lyrics I think though


I need to do some testing on the drum machine to make sure this doesn't happen again - I think the switchboard needs to be soldered in properly to avoid these problems, but tbh I *still* can't figure out what went wrong with it - maybe if I'd restarted it earlier in the set then it would have been fine.

##05: Landfill music

-fix that gap in the intro!

It won't be long
Till you move on from this
to another song
and on and on to the next one next one

we're moving onto **landfill**
we're gonna make **landfill music**
we're working an assembly line
filling up the **land fill land fill**

muuuuuuusic (synth under)

Second Verse
Exactly the same as the first
plastic feelings
that won't degrade for a hundred years because

this is just **landfill**
we make **landfill music**
we're working an assembly line
filling up the **land fill land fill**

if your Feeling low
it's too late to say so say so
can't find the pictures
can't make the scene because

it's all going into landfill

too many wankers, plastic 
feelings, and not enough control

#bme700

Currently the following sounds are stored:

1 - A good sound - don't think it's used at present - good alternative to 5
2 - Harsh noise - unused, but reliable across the keyboard
3 - MartynLives bass (an hbf sound)
4 - Unlike Me
5 - Default Tightrope bass
6 - A bit of a 'quack' - loud attack, fast decay, quiet sustain, immediate release
7 - A 'stock' memory - poppy bass - used on one of the experimental tracks from around 2014
8 - Heavy bass

##hbf bme 

There was a bug with the roadrunner.sh - it wrote the roadrunner memories to the bme700 directory - resulting in some really strange sounds! 

###Currently
1 - grainy alternative to 5
2 - Harsh noise
3 - MartynLives
4 - Unlike Me
5 - Default Tightrope
6 - No Note Off
7 - stock pop
8 - Heavy Bass


###Used to be (stored in 170529 subdir);
*Worth keeping note of this as we keep getting confused...*

1 - Another good sound - different to 1 in trset1/BME700 - don't delete!
2 - Another harsh noise
3 - whooshing
4 - slow fade in whooshin
5 - A strange clicky LFO thing
6 - A bit of a 'quack' - loud attack, fast decay, quiet sustain, immediate release
7 - A 'stock' memory - poppy bass - used on one of the experimental tracks from around 2014
8 - Harpsichord type thing
