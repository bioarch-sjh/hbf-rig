##05: Landfill music

-fix that gap in the intro!

It won't be long
Till you move on from this
to another song
and on and on to the next one next one

we're moving onto **landfill**
we're gonna make **landfill music**
we're working an assembly line
filling up the **land fill land fill**

muuuuuuusic (synth under)

Second Verse
Exactly the same as the first
plastic feelings
that won't degrade for a hundred years because

this is just **landfill**
we make **landfill music**
we're working an assembly line
filling up the **land fill land fill**

if your Feeling low
it's too late to say so say so
can't find the pictures
can't make the scene because

it's all going into landfill

#bme700

Currently the following sounds are stored:

1 - A good sound - don't think it's used at present - good alternative to 5
2 - Harsh noise - unused, but reliable across the keyboard
3 - MartynLives bass (an hbf sound)
4 - Unlike Me
5 - Default Tightrope bass
6 - A bit of a 'quack' - loud attack, fast decay, quiet sustain, immediate release
7 - A 'stock' memory - poppy bass - used on one of the experimental tracks from around 2014
8 - Heavy bass

##hbf bme 

There was a bug with the roadrunner.sh - it wrote the roadrunner memories to the bme700 directory - resulting in some really strange sounds! 

###Currently
1 - grainy alternative to 5
2 - Harsh noise
3 - MartynLives
4 - Unlike Me
5 - Default Tightrope
6 - No Note Off
7 - stock pop
8 - Heavy Bass


###Used to be (stored in 170529 subdir);
*Worth keeping note of this as we keep getting confused...*

1 - Another good sound - different to 1 in trset1/BME700 - don't delete!
2 - Another harsh noise
3 - whooshing
4 - slow fade in whooshin
5 - A strange clicky LFO thing
6 - A bit of a 'quack' - loud attack, fast decay, quiet sustain, immediate release
7 - A 'stock' memory - poppy bass - used on one of the experimental tracks from around 2014
8 - Harpsichord type thing
